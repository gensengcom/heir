# Heir ♦️
Heir (Hold'em Intermediate Representation) is a colletion of libraries and applications for interfacing with the `.heir.md` and `.heir.bin` standardized Texas Hold'em poker hand history formats. This monorepo includes:
- **heir**: an API for transpiling between Heir human-readable markdown notation, Heir compressed binaries, and numerous third-party hand history formats.
- **heir-cfr**: a CLI and API for running counterfactual regret minimizaiton in Heir-defined hand contexts.
- **heir-handgen**: a CLI for artificially generating intelligently-random hand histories.

This repository is updated incrementally from an upstream closed-source version.
